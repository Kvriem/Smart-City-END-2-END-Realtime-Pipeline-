# Smart City Real-Time Analytics Platform - Architecture Guide

## üéØ PROJECT CONTEXT
I'm building a smart city data platform with:
- **Current Setup**: Kafka ‚Üí Spark Streaming ‚Üí S3 (running on Docker Compose)
- **Data Types**: GPS, Ambulance, Weather, Camera, Traffic data
- **Goal**: Add real-time analytics, dashboards, batch processing, and ML capabilities
- **Architecture Choice**: Real-Time Analytics & Dashboard Platform (Lambda Architecture)

---

## üìã IMPLEMENTATION PHASES

### **Phase 1: Dual-Stream Architecture Setup** ‚≠ê **START HERE**
**Goal**: Add real-time layer while keeping existing batch layer

**Key Components**:
- Redis (speed layer for real-time data)
- Elasticsearch (search and aggregations)
- Kibana (quick analytics dashboard)
- Grafana (monitoring and metrics)
- MinIO (local S3-compatible storage)

**Critical Decisions Made**:
- **Data Consistency**: Eventual consistency accepted (30-60 second lag is fine)
- **Redis Strategy**: Cache with TTL, not primary database
- **Failure Handling**: Graceful degradation (system works without Redis)

---

### **Phase 2: Enhanced Stream Processing**
**Goal**: Improve Spark streaming with windowing and state management

**Focus Areas**:
- Multi-stream processing (separate logic for each data type)
- Window strategies (1-min for GPS, 5-min for traffic, real-time for emergencies)
- State management for aggregations
- Backpressure handling

**Tricky Points to Watch**:
- Memory accumulation in long-running Spark jobs
- Late-arriving data handling
- Data skew (some roads have 1000x more data)
- Exactly-once vs at-least-once processing

---

### **Phase 3: Real-Time API Layer** ‚≠ê **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Goal**: Create APIs to serve real-time data from Redis

**API Strategy**:
- REST APIs for standard queries
- WebSocket for real-time dashboard updates
- Multi-level caching (Redis ‚Üí App cache)
- Circuit breaker pattern for Redis failures

**Key Endpoints Needed**:
- `/api/traffic/live/<road_id>` - Current traffic conditions
- `/api/vehicles/locations` - All vehicle positions
- `/api/emergencies/active` - Active emergency situations
- `/api/analytics/traffic-summary` - City-wide summary

---

### **Phase 4: Batch Processing with Airflow**
**Goal**: Add scheduled analytics and data quality workflows

**Focus Areas**:
- Daily analytics DAGs
- Data quality checks
- Historical trend analysis
- Lambda architecture reconciliation (merge batch + real-time views)

**Critical Considerations**:
- Resource contention (batch vs real-time jobs)
- Data partitioning strategy
- Failure recovery mechanisms
- Late data handling

---

### **Phase 5: ML Pipeline** ‚ö†Ô∏è **ADVANCED - IMPLEMENT LAST**
**Goal**: Add predictive capabilities

**ML Applications**:
- Traffic speed prediction
- Ambulance route optimization
- Congestion pattern analysis
- Weather-traffic correlation

**Architecture Decisions**:
- Training: Batch processing on historical data
- Inference: Real-time on streaming data
- Model serving: Embedded vs separate service
- A/B testing for model versions

---

### **Phase 6: Dashboard & Visualization**
**Goal**: Build React dashboard for real-time monitoring

**Dashboard Components**:
- Live traffic map
- Emergency response panel
- Traffic speed trends
- City-wide analytics summary

**Technical Strategy**:
- WebSockets for real-time updates
- Progressive loading for performance
- Offline handling capabilities

## üö® CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS

### **Data Flow Strategy** (DECIDED)
```
Kafka ‚Üí Spark Streaming ‚Üí {
    S3 (batch layer - historical analysis)
    Redis (speed layer - real-time queries)
}
```

### **Consistency Model** (DECIDED)
- **Chosen**: Eventual consistency
- **Rationale**: 30-60 second lag acceptable for smart city use case
- **Impact**: Simpler architecture, better performance

### **Failure Handling** (DECIDED)
- **Strategy**: Graceful degradation
- **Implementation**: System continues working without Redis, falls back to batch data
- **Monitoring**: Alert when real-time layer fails

### **Technology Stack** (DECIDED)
- **Stream Processing**: Spark Streaming (existing)
- **Speed Layer**: Redis with TTL policies
- **Search/Analytics**: Elasticsearch + Kibana
- **Monitoring**: Grafana
- **Orchestration**: Airflow
- **API**: Flask/FastAPI
- **Frontend**: React with real-time updates

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN TRICKY POINTS & SOLUTIONS

### **Redis Memory Management**
- **Problem**: Redis can run out of memory
- **Solution**: Implement TTL policies, monitor memory usage, use LRU eviction
- **Monitoring**: Alert when memory > 80%

### **Spark Streaming State Accumulation**
- **Problem**: Long-running jobs accumulate memory
- **Solution**: Regular checkpointing, stateful operations cleanup
- **Monitoring**: Track heap usage over time

### **Data Quality Issues**
- **Problem**: Malformed or missing data
- **Solution**: Data validation at ingestion, dead letter queues for bad data
- **Strategy**: Log and continue vs fail fast (chosen: log and continue)

### **Backpressure Handling**
- **Problem**: Redis can't keep up with Spark writes
- **Solution**: Write buffering, batch writes to Redis, circuit breaker pattern
- **Monitoring**: Track write latencies and queue sizes

### **Dashboard Performance**
- **Problem**: Too much real-time data crashes browsers
- **Solution**: Data sampling, progressive loading, update throttling
- **Strategy**: Update critical widgets every 5 seconds, others every 30 seconds

## üéØ IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY ORDER

### **Recommended Start Order**:
1. **Phase 1** - Infrastructure setup (immediate value, manageable complexity)
2. **Phase 3** - API layer (enables integrations, quick wins)
3. **Phase 6** - Basic dashboard (stakeholder visibility)
4. **Phase 2** - Enhanced stream processing (enables advanced analytics)
5. **Phase 4** - Batch processing (operational efficiency)
6. **Phase 5** - ML pipeline (advanced features)

### **Success Criteria for Each Phase**:

## ü§î KEY QUESTIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION

### **Before Starting Each Phase, Ask**:
1. **Value**: What specific problem does this solve?
2. **Complexity**: Can I build and maintain this?
3. **Dependencies**: What needs to be working first?
4. **Risk**: What's the worst that can happen?
5. **Success Metrics**: How do I know it's working?

### **Ongoing Architecture Questions**:
- **Data Retention**: Keep GPS data for 24 hours in Redis, traffic aggregations for 7 days
- **Scaling**: Design for 1000 vehicles, 100 roads, 10 hospitals initially
- **Monitoring**: Focus on data freshness, processing latency, system availability
- **Security**: Basic auth for APIs, no PII in logs

2. Modify existing Spark job to write to both S3 and Redis
3. Create basic Flask API to serve data from Redis
4. Test end-to-end data flow

### **Success Indicators**:
- Can query live GPS locations via API
